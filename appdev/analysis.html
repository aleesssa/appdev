                         <h3>1. Paid App</h3>
                         <p>Some app is not free on the app store. Sometimes user likely won’t download the app because they don’t want to pay for something that they may delete later. Additionally, some app can get quite pricey.</p>

                         <h3>2. Security of App</h3>
                         <p>It is hard to successfully secure mobile apps. App developers need to work with the security systems.</p>
                         <p>Hackers and malware that could compromise app user’s security are always updating and improving their methods and software, so app developers need to update their software to protect against them. Also, to keep the app secure, user need to pay quite a bit of money. However, in the end, it will be worth it.</p>

                         <p>Mobile app need to periodically keep updated so it will work well with the users’ phones. While these updates allow to improve and add new features. iPhones and Android phones seem to go through a software update every few months. As these phones update, older phones sometimes have trouble accessing the new software because older iPhones are notorious for not functioning with the most recent IOS software updates. New features will announced to the users so they can update the app to avoid malfunction new software updates.</p>

               <div class="column">
                    <h3>1. Waterfall Methodology</h3>
                         <p>Waterfall methodology  is a method by planning and sequence. The entire project is mapped out in the planning and analysis stages.</p>
                         <h4>The Advantages :</h4>
                    
                         <ul>
                              <li>It is useable and a good method for big projects (that need to have one unifying vision) </li>
                              <li>Easier to train junior or newbie programmers on development parts without handing over an entire project</li>
                         </ul>
                    
                         <h4>The Disadvantages :</h4>
                         <ul>
                              <li>Changes happen all the time</li>
                              <li>Even if the development team can build exactly what the customers originally wanted the market, technology, or organization may have changed so much that it is useless and a waste of time.</li>
                         </ul>
                
                    
                    <h3>2. Rapid Application Development(RAD) Methodology</h3>
                         <p>The app development team and the customer work with each other throughout the process. RAD teams are usually small and only involve experienced developers skilled in many disciplines. If a project needs to divert from the original plan, RAD should be able to accommodate that easily.</p>
                    
                         <h4>The Advantages :</h4>
                    
                         <ul>
                              <li>RAD is a quick method, highly flexible team and a close customer relationship.</li>
                              <li>It able to accommodate changes much faster than Waterfall method.</li>
                              <li>It is also never too attached to a prototype and is always willing to change it to suit the needs of the customer</li>
                         </ul>
                    
                         <h4>The Disadvantages :</h4>
                    
                         <ul>
                              <li>RAD feature requires highly skilled and highly paid programmers to work on a project that may have change in complexity by the day</li>
                              <li>There's also less adherence to deadlines and more focus on adding features, which is can extend delivery dates.</li>
                              <li>Some applications having a ptototype is not useful without seeing the entire product.</li>
                         </ul>
                    
                    
                    <h3>3. Agile methodology</h3>
                         <p>Agile method is similar to RAD method but includes some changes to make it more suitable for larger projects. Agile method is iterative like RAD, but focuses on building features individually. </p>
                    
                         <h4>Advantages :</h4>
                         <ul>
                              <li>It is high quality final product</li>
                              <li>Customers satisfaction</li>
                              <li>More flexible</li>
                              <li>Offers a faster delivery to customer</li>
                              <li>Provide better communication</li>
                         </ul>
                    
                         <h4>The disadvantages :</h4>
                         <ul>
                              <li>It is hard to predict</li>
                              <li>The final product is not released first</li>
                              <li>Documentation is left for last</li>
